## üöÄ Key Features

- **Blazing Fast URL Discovery:** Uses **Katana** in a high-concurrency bulk mode to crawl thousands of domains in minutes, not hours.
- **Intelligent LFI Detection:** Employs a **Dynamic Differential Analysis** technique, comparing page content similarity to accurately detect LFI with a very low false-positive rate.
- **Evasive Blind SQLi Engine:**
  - **Multi-Vector Attack:** Tests both **URL Parameters** and **HTTP Headers** for SQLi.
  - **Multi-Technique Approach:** Automatically uses **Standard Injection**, **HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)**, and **Out-of-Band (OOB)** techniques.
  - **Traceable OOB Payloads:** When using OOB, each payload is embedded with a unique ID that is logged on-screen and to a file, allowing for perfect attribution of any callbacks.
  - **Evasive Payloads:** Utilizes a massive, curated list of advanced, time-based and OOB payloads, prioritizing `XOR`-based and conditional logic to bypass WAFs.
  - **Randomized & Isolated Testing:** Evades detection by randomizing the order of methods and headers tested and injecting payloads into only one header at a time.
- **Real-Time, Dual-Channel Alerts:** Sends an **immediate, detailed notification to your terminal screen AND Slack** for every confirmed vulnerability, complete with verifiable curl commands.
- **Flexible Workflow & Payloads:**
  - Run in **Discovery Mode** or **Direct URL Testing Mode**.
  - Comes with a massive, curated list of built-in LFI & SQLi payloads.
  - Option to use your own custom LFI payload file.
- **Professional Presentation & Organization:**
  - Features a fully animated, custom startup banner.
  - Creates a unique, timestamped directory for each scan to store all logs, preventing data contamination.

### RUN OVER VPS FOR MOST ACCURATE RESULTS

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

This tool is designed to run on a Linux-based environment (like Kali, Ubuntu, or a VPS).

First, install the required Python libraries. If you encounter an `externally-managed-environment` error, the `--user` flag is the recommended quick fix.

```bash
pip3 install rich requests
```
# Web Crawler
``go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/cmd/katana@latest``

# URL Deduplicator
pipx install uro

# Pattern Matching Tool
``go install -v github.com/tomnomnom/gf@latest``

# Vulnerability Scanner
``go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest``


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Usage

### Initial Configuration

Before running, you must configure the tool:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone [Your-GitHub-Repo-URL-Here]
cd P1-URLs
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Usage

### Initial Setup
1. **Make the Script Executable**:
```bash
chmod +x P1-URLs.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Scan Modes

### üîç Standard Discovery Mode

Find and test URLs from a list of domains using Katana and built-in modules.

```bash
./P1-URLs.py -l domains.txt
```

## Direct URL Testing Mode

Test a pre-existing list of URLs directly for LFI/SQLi vulnerabilities.

``./P1-URLs.py -l my_url_list.txt -u``

### Custom LFI Payloads Mode

Use your own list of LFI payloads instead of the built-in wordlist.

``./P1-URLs.py -l domains.txt -p /path/to/custom_lfi_payloads.txt``

### üß† Advanced: Out-of-Band (OOB) SQLi Testing

This is the most powerful detection mode for super-blind SQLi using OOB payloads.

  üîÅ Step 1: Start Interactsh/Burp Collab client

``interactsh-client/Burp Collab``

  üöÄ Step 2: Run the scan with your unique OOB URL

``./P1-URLs.py -l domains.txt -c your-unique-id.oast.online``

üí° Note: Match interaction callback IDs with vulnerable targets by checking:

``oob_requests.log``

### üìÇ Output Structure

Results are saved inside a timestamped directory like:
``scan_results_domains_2023-10-27_15-30-00/``
